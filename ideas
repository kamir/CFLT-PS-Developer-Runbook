## Kafka Backup

https://github.com/osodevops/kafka-backup

kafka-backup is a production-grade tool written in Rust for backing up and restoring Apache Kafka topics to cloud storage or local filesystem. It supports point-in-time recovery (PITR) with millisecond precision and solves the consumer group offset discontinuity problem when restoring to different clusters.

Features
Multi-cloud storage — S3, Azure Blob, GCS, or local filesystem
Point-in-time recovery — Restore to any millisecond within your backup window
Consumer offset recovery — Automatically reset consumer group offsets after restore
High performance — 100+ MB/s throughput with zstd/lz4 compression
Incremental backups — Resume from where you left off
Topic filtering — Wildcard patterns for include/exclude
Deployment agnostic — Bare metal, VM, Docker, or Kubernetes

## Tableflow Terraform Demo

This project contains Terraform scripts to provision and configure a modern data pipeline using Confluent Cloud, AWS, and (optionally) Databricks and Snowflake. It automates the creation of Kafka topics, IAM roles, S3 buckets, and all necessary integrations for Tableflow and streaming analytics.
